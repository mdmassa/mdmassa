      <h5>I'm a computer engineering student currently working as a webdesigner at Base startup and also as a programmer and artist on the game development team Call From Beyond, on the Drunk Quest project. Around 2007-2009, when the LAN house fever had already spread across Brazil, I spent almost entire afternoons playing the most diverse types of games (GTA San Andreas, World of Warcraft, Need for Speed, Counter Strike 1.6, Call of Duty etc), until one day I decided that I would create my first game, a kind of escape room, using Blender platform. Since then my passion for programming and creating games has grown.
      My first programming language was PHP (not that I'm proud of it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and MySQL when I was studying Programming for Web Development at CECAPE Institute, where I also learned HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</h5>
